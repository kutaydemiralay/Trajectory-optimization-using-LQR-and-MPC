# Trajectory-optimization-using-LQR-and-MPC

In this project, our aim is to optimize the trajectory of a free-flying robot with respect to given dynamics and constraints. We will be using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) method for a non-noisy flying environment, and to achieve robustness against disturbance (wind in our case), we will use the Model Predictive Control (MPC) method.
